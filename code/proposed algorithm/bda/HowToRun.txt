[in MATLAB]
Step 1. To estimate the best prior :
1a. Run CreateSourceSampleDatasets.m  ### To generate 100 sample datasets from source data [Replace Source Data filename in the code]
1b. Run ParameterPriorDistribution.m ### To get the cross-validation classification accuracy for hidden nodes 2 to 50 for each dataset 
1c. Run EstimateBestParameterPriorDistribution.m ### To get the best prior accuracy and standard deviation (also the distribution)

Step 2. To estimate the best posterior :
2a. Run CreateTargetPoolDatasets.m  ### To generate 10 pairs of pools and test datasets from target data taking 50% of the samples as pool (for active learning)
		[Replace Target Data filename in the code] [This step is independent of the step 1]
2b. Run LCEQ_Pool1.m to LCEQ_Pool10.m in parallel/sequential ### For Active learning (to obtain the queried examples) 
		[Replace PRIOR_MEAN in the code with the mean of the prior distribution as stored in BestPriorsMean.csv from Step 1c]
2c. Run EstimateBestParameterPosterior_VC3_Pool1.m to EstimateBestParameterPosterior_VC3_Pool10.m in parallel/sequential ### 
		[Replace PRIOR_MEAN in the code with the mean of the prior distribution as stored in BestPriorsMean.csv from Step 1c]
2d. Run AnalyzeResults.m to get the final mean accuracy across all the test datasets
		[Replace PRIOR_MEAN in the code with the mean of the prior distribution as stored in BestPriorsMean.csv from Step 1c]
